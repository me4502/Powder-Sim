			<h3>Dummy Text</h3>
		
			<p>
				Ten years ago a crack commando unit was sent to prison by a military court for a crime they didn't commit.
				These men promptly escaped from a maximum security stockade to the Los Angeles underground. Today, still
				wanted by the government, they survive as soldiers of fortune. If you have a problem and no one else can help,
				and if you can find them, maybe you can hire the A-team.
